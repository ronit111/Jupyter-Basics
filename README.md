# US Births

In this guided project of DataQuest, we work with US Births dataset, compiled by FiveThirtyEight.

Here are some suggestions for next steps:

Write a function that can calculate the min and max values for any dictionary that's passed in.
Write a function that extracts the same values across years and calculates the differences between consecutive values to show if number of births is increasing or decreasing.
For example, how did the number of births on Saturday change each year between 1994 and 2003?
Find a way to combine the CDC data with the SSA data, which you can find here. Specifically, brainstorm ways to deal with the overlapping time periods in the datasets.
